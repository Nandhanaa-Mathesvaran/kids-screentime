Indian kids screentime analysis

This dataset simulates screen time patterns of 9712 Indian children aged 8 to 18 years, built using real-world trends and scientific studies conducted in India between 2023–2024. It combines urban and rural demographics, reflecting differences in device access, screen habits, and health outcomes.

Screen time is broken down by:

Age and gender

Primary screen device (e.g., smartphone, TV)

Time split between educational and recreational use

Whether screen time exceeds Indian Academy of Pediatrics (IAP) guidelines

Likely health impacts (e.g., poor sleep, eye strain, anxiety)

 Background & Motivation
In recent years, screen exposure among Indian children has surged, particularly post-COVID. Studies show:

Adolescents average 4–5 hours/day on screens.

Over 70% exceed the healthy recommended screen time.

83% of rural teens report excessive usage.

High screen time correlates with sleep problems, obesity risk, and anxiety.
